npm used to install external libraries or frameworks or utility

-g installs things globally meaning you can use it in other projects
however, most of the time, installing locally is recommended

installed nodemon, used so you dont have to restart server after making
changes to file

package.json file will have dependencies

node_modules file usually not in github repos, just need package.json 
and do npm install or npm i to install all the dependencies/external tools

thats how dependencies are shared/how other developers use the same ones

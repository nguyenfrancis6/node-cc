client types up a domain name, server sends back a response 
domain name is masking an ip address, the address of a computer providing the resources
server will take the request and send a response, usually a html page
could send back json, css, or other files

searching up domain name deals with GET http method / GET request
Communication via HTTP  

localhost is a loopback ip address, similar to a domain name on the web
localhost points to 127.0.0.1 which points to our own computer
allows us to use computer as a host when developing web apps

Port numbers: 
similar to 'doors' into a computer

Returning html pages is better by making the html pages separately from node code, 
using a switch statement to check for routes and adding corresponding pages
can check routes by using the request's url property and adding it to the 
path to your html files

Also, setting statuscodes for your response to signify the results
100 range is informational
200 is usually success
300 is redirect
400s is a problem on client
500 is internal server error

common ones are 200, 301, 404, 500

to redirect, set code to 301
set the header to location and set the route to whichever page is desired
